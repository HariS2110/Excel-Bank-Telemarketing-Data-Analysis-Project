# Excel-Bank-Telemarketing-Data-Analysis-Project
This repository contains the code and dataset for my first-ever data analysis project, where I explored a bank's telemarketing campaign data to identify key customer attributes that correlate with higher response rates. The objective of this project is to predict which customers are more likely to purchase certain products when contacted through telemarketing.
